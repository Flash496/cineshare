## Backend Status: ✅ WORKING

- Backend running on http://localhost:3001
- TMDB API Key loaded: e25c8188...
- Routes mapped correctly:
  - ✅ `/movies/trending`
  - ✅ `/movies/popular`
  - ✅ `/movies/search`
- Database connected
- Cache module initialized

**Test Result:** `curl http://localhost:3001/movies/trending` returns movie data ✅

## Frontend Status: ⚠️ NEEDS RESTART

- `.env.local` file exists ✅
- Contains: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001` ✅

## Solution

You need to **restart the frontend dev server**:

1. Stop the current frontend server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running `npm run dev`)
2. Restart it:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Refresh your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Expected Result

After restarting, the homepage should show:
- ✅ "Trending This Week" carousel with movie posters
- ✅ "Popular Movies" carousel with movie posters
- ✅ Search bar working

The issue was that Next.js needs to be restarted to pick up environment variables from `.env.local` file.
