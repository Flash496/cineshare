## Backend Requirements

The backend already has these endpoints:
- ✅ `GET /movies/:id` - Main movie details
- ✅ `GET /movies/:id/credits` - Cast and crew
- ✅ `GET /movies/:id/videos` - Trailers/videos
- ✅ `GET /movies/:id/similar` - Similar movies
- ✅ `GET /movies/:id/reviews` - User reviews

All endpoints are public (marked with `@Public()` decorator).

## How It Works

1. **User clicks movie** → Navigate to `/movies/123`
2. **Page loads** → Fetch movie details from backend
3. **Fetch additional data** → Credits, videos, similar movies
4. **Display everything** → Render all components
5. **User interacts** → Watch trailer, expand reviews, etc.

## Error Handling

- ✅ Movie not found → Shows 404 page
- ✅ API errors → Logs to console, shows fallback
- ✅ Missing images → Uses placeholder
- ✅ No reviews → Shows friendly message
- ✅ No similar movies → Shows "None found"

## Performance

- ✅ Parallel data fetching (Promise.all)
- ✅ Server-side rendering (SSR)
- ✅ Revalidation cache (1 hour)
- ✅ Optimized images (Next.js Image)
- ✅ Lazy loading for heavy sections

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add user reviews (backend module)
2. Implement watchlist functionality
3. Add movie recommendations based on user viewing
4. Add "Back to results" button
5. Add share functionality
6. Add rating submission
